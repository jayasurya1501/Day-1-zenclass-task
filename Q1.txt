1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2


Multiplexing Magic:

     HTTP/1.1 relies on sequential requests, establishing different connections for each object. 
However, HTTP/2 introduces multiplexing, allowing data to flow over one connection at a time. 
This increases loading speeds and enhances the user experience.

Header Efficiency:

     HTTP/1.1 sends headers in plain text with each request, eliminating unnecessary data transfers. 
Configure HTTP/2 with header compression, which reduces overhead. This not only reduces latency 
but also makes better use of network resources.

Binary Brilliance:

     While HTTP/1.1 communicates in a human-readable textual content layout, HTTP/2 adopts a binary protocol.
This streamlined approach improves parsing performance and decreases file sizes, resulting in quicker records
switch and quicker page masses.

To push the limits with Server Push:

     HTTP/2 introduces a game-changer called Server Push. Instead of waiting for client requests, servers 
actively push resources. This predictable process speeds up page loading, especially for complex web applications.
