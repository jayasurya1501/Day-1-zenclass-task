2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Object Basics:

    *Objects are collections of key-value pairs.
    *Properties, consisting of keys and values, define an object's structure.

Internal Storage:

    *Object properties are stored in a hash table, enabling efficient data retrieval.
    *Hash values are calculated for quick property access.

Optimization Techniques:

    *JavaScript engines use hidden classes and shape trees to optimize property access.
    *Hidden classes represent object blueprints; shape trees depict the hierarchy of these classes.

Prototypes and Inheritance:

    *Objects can have prototypes, forming a chain for inheritance.
    *Prototypes create a tree-like structure with shared references.
